					<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-snow-storm-B.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" title="The  snow storm  B" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-snow-storm-B.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><br />
An old fashioned blizzard came last Saturday and Sunday. First warm moist air blew in from the south and ran into the cold air coming from Canada. The snow came down heavy and the wind blew hard from the South East. Then during Sunday the wind switched to the North West and gusted up to 35 MPH. We were lucky they had predicted gusts over 40 MPH. The temp dropped through the night to 8 below 0 Fahrenheit. You won&#8217;t last long outside in weather like that. The good thing is the dropping temperature ended the snow.<br />
I stayed in mostly, took a few pictures outside, and checked that everything was OK. I can&#8217;t take the cold like I used to.<br />
    It brought back memories of the days when I was a boy. Storms were exciting, if they came during the week you would have days off from school. One of the best things was I was allowed to stay up as late as I wanted. The whole family would be home and during the storm, outside work was held to a minimum. Often we all sit by the kitchen table and play games, read by the gas lamp or just talk.<br />
The wood fire in the kitchen range would be burning at maximum. The draft damper on the back of the stove would click as the wind gusts swept by the chimney. The sound was fascinating, a regular tapping that was completely random. It was like a strange kind of music. I don&#8217;t think anyone else ever paid attention to that sound.<br />
In the 1940&#8242;s the road through the farm was the main north south highway. It connected the two county seats , Willmar and Olivia. I can remember having people snowed in for the night. The one I remember best was a fellow with a grocery delivery van. He had become stuck on the road by our farm grove and dad pulled his van in the yard with his team of horses. It was war time and many things were rationed. All the fruit and food that could be damaged by freezing were carried into the house for the night.<br />
He was outgoing and full of fun, with a loud laugh. I was given bananas, cherry&#8217;s and other goodies to eat, and he encouraged me to eat more of what I liked. When dad would remind us that we should be conserving these good things, he would laugh and say it would all have been lost in the cold if it wasn&#8217;t for you, so enjoy. I remember the laughing and talk going on into the night. I think I fell asleep in my mothers lap, I don&#8217;t remember. When I awoke the next morning, the storm had ended, the snow plough had come by, and the fellow had left.<br />
Below is a picture early Monday morning. The sun was shinning bright, the air is clear and cold at a minus 9. I always remember it being beautiful after a blizzard. My sister and I would take the sled or shiny scoop shovels and slide on the new drifts.<br />
The work horse&#8217;s would be so happy to run free in the barn yard even if it was cold, after being cooped up for a couple of days. They would run,jump, buck and pass gas noisily.<br />
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/the-sun-is-out-again-temp-9-below-B.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" title="the sun is out again temp  9 below B" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/the-sun-is-out-again-temp-9-below-B.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><br />
It is so beautiful outside. Sparkling white in the bright sun. One could feel a bit of warmth from the sun and a crisp cold from the air. We had 15 inches of snow but it never lays still on the prairie. The next picture shows my farm field, you can see soil showing through the snow cover. The wind has swept the snow into farm yards, fence lines and road ditches. When the wind blows from a different direction the snow will move again.<br />
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/after-storm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990" title="after storm" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/after-storm.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><br />
I have two more pictures to show. The first shows a job for me . the snow flying off the snow plough lays the mailbox down often. Not serious, just a bit of work, worth it to have the road open. The second one shows why we had a quiet time during the storm. That little amount of snow that stuck to the dish, blocked the TV signal from the satellite very effectively.<br />

				<div class="postmetadata">30th November 2012, 11:17 am  <!-- by rod --></div>
				<div class="postentry">
					<p>The spring, summer and fall went fast. The beautiful spring turned into a hot summer. Then came a nice fall with all its colour&#8217;s, now this  has disappeared.</p>
<p>I took pictures this spring of a quick little project I did. I planned to put it in on the web site then. I tend to spend little time at the computer when the weather is nice outside so I just never got around to it. Now it has turned colder outside, so it is more comfortable by my computer. I will now show them to you.<br />
The mower deck on my old Yard Man lawnmower tractor failed a year ago this fall. The unit is 10 years old and I mow a large area. The repairs would have cost over half of what I paid for the unit new. So I replaced the unit with a new John Deere garden tractor-mower unit.<br />
We started using it to pull the old trailer in the picture. We hauled yard scraps and leaves out to the compost pile in the back part of the farm grove. Soon we were using it to haul many things around the large farmyard. My Wife and I both found it handy as we left it hitched to the trailer. Without the mower it was easier to get off and on. The only problem was it was very difficult for two of us to ride on it.<br />
As you can see I solved the problem with a few hours work and stuff I had around the farm.<br />
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/finnished-project.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-940" title="finnished project" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/finnished-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
It was simple as the original seat was held to a flat bracket with two bolts. This kept the original spring system in place for a nice ride.<br />
The cost was nothing, as I used stuff I have saved. A couple of pieces of 3/4 plywood I have had for years. some left over foam rubber and vinyl upholstery material. Rummaging through my salvage iron found the pieces I needed to make brackets to hold the backrest.<a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seat-construction.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-942" title="seat construction" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seat-construction-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
As you can see I had to double the brackets around the bend for strength. I did maintain some spring in the backrest however.</p>
<p>Donna came to my aid with here skill and creativity. she did the upholstery work and I think it turned out looking very good.<br />
I did run into a bit of a problem with the mower lift lever and the shift lever. They both stuck up too high and interfered with the seat.</p>
<p>I fired up my old acetylene welding torch that I purchased in the early 1960&#8242;s. Although not used much in this day and age, it cured the problem easily, as you can see by the next two Photos.</p>
<p>The mower lift handle could have been removed as it is unused but this was simpler. You never know I may figure a use for it down the road.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lift-handle.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-944" title="Lift handle" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lift-handle-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></a><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/shift-lever.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-945" title="shift lever" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/shift-lever-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="185" /></a></p>

<p>The next picture shows Donna and My Grandson Thorwald. He and his brother Gunnar both enjoyed driving around the farm. The seat allows them to learn to drive safely and to enjoy giving Me or Grandma a ride. Donna and I have both enjoyed using my customised garden tractor.</p>

<p>I ran across this cast iron hinge wile I was cleaning up on the old farmstead. It was in an old pail mixed with an assortment of  rusty bolts, washers, burrs and iron.</p>
<p>It was covered with layers of old paint and grease. The scrap iron pile was tempting but I decided to clean it up a bit.  The picture shows the result.</p>
<p>The artwork is amazing for something as utilitarian as  a hinge. It also has an unique feature. Inside is a spring that would close the door. It must have been used on a screen door. I am not sure of the age. It is probable it came from the house which was built in 1903.</p>
<div id="attachment_792" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-792" title="Old_Hinge_B" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Old_Hinge_B-150x150.jpg" alt="Hinge back side" width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hinge back side</p></div>
<p>I have included a picture of the back side. That even looks ornate. I know it was used for years because  it shows some wear. the size is about 2 inches by 3 inches.</p>
<p>I am somewhat of a pack rat but I haven&#8217;t been able to think of a good use for this hinge. I would be interested in more information about it</p>
<p>I will sell this for $25.00, pulls actual shipping cost or you would be welcome to pick it up in person. I would also be open to offers.</p>
<p>I can be reached by E-Mail at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net</strong></p>

<p>I have always been curious about how things are made. I often take things apart just to see what is inside. Above is a hard drive I took apart the other day. one of the interesting things were the magnets. they are the strongest magnets I have ever played with. The flat curved piece in the lower right of the above picture is the magnet after I pried it off the bracket in the lower right corner.<br />
the pile of parts got pushed aside on my work space while I started another quick project. While laying my soldering iron down I tipped the cheap tin rest over. This was very annoying. The thin strong magnet came to my mind. It fit perfectly under the tin rest and held it firmly to the bench top. I just needed to fasten the magnet to the rest, so I could move it around easily.<br />
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/01/B-Ready-for-glue-300x192.jpg" alt="B Ready for glue" title="B Ready for glue" width="300" height="192" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-737" /><br />
Naturally I reached for the <strong>J B Weld</strong>. A good coating and I pushed the magnet in tight.<img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/01/C-applying-Glue-300x285.jpg" alt="C applying Glue" title="C applying Glue" width="300" height="285" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-741" /> <img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/01/finnished-project-300x280.jpg" alt="finnished project" title="finnished project" width="300" height="280" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-743" /> I spotted a piece of foam and put on the bottom. That way I didn&#8217;t have to clean up the J B Weld I had over most of the bottom. It also keeps the rest from scratching the desk surface. The rest now stays firmly in one place but is also easily moved. No more tipping over when you bump the cord or Iron. A simple fun project making use of junk.</p>

					<p>2011 passed very fast. I stayed busy but didn&#8217;t get many of my planned projects finished. Looking back I realise that it really doesn&#8217;t matter. It was a great year and I had much fun. I didn&#8217;t keep up the web site. I started many posts but never seemed to finish anything. The weather was rainy and stormy in the spring, which kept me very busy cleaning up broken trees. Then it turned dry and sunny for the rest of summer and I spent most of my time outdoors.<br />
 Below is a picture of metal car on my shop wall. It was a Birthday gift from my Son, Daughter-in-law and two Boys. They have a knack for picking gifts that this old man loves.<br />
      I spend a lot of time in my shop and it is filled with things. Every thing has a story, a memory and sometimes a use. Sometimes I just sit and look and let the good memory&#8217;s flood in. Friends and good times, long since past, come awake again.<br />
      I have always loved to tinker. At a early age I started taking things apart just to see what was inside them, and what made them work. Looking back I can see my father was very tolerant. I was encouraged to disassemble junk items rather than good stuff and allowed full access to his workshop and tools. Over time I learned to put things back together again and eventually I made my living doing just that.<br />
You will also note the old wood wall mount telephone on the wall. I found it in Arkansas last winter when we were south. My memory identifies it as a match to the one on kitchen wall when I was a child. I was always fascinated by the old telephone with a crank on the side instead of a dial. There were 8 to 10 people on the party line. When any phone rang, all the phones rang. needles to say privacy was non-existent. No one would admit &#8220;Rubbering&#8221;, as listening in was then called. With no electricity limiting radio use, small children and lots of hard work, the diversion of &#8220;Rubbering&#8221; was understandable.<br />
   My mother was too busy to listen to the radio one morning when the phone rang. It was the local radio station&#8217;s morning quiz show. They asked a question that would have been simple had she been listening to the show. Her mind was so busy with the days work it just couldn&#8217;t move onto the question. The clocked ticked off as she stood silent by the phone. Suddenly a woman&#8217;s voice blurted out the answer and my mother was declared the winner of a small gift certificate at one of the show sponsors. My mother would have been glad to share the gift, but no one would ever admit to being the voice. I must add, that unlike today, the tone quality of the old phones was very poor. Recognising the voice for sure was impossible.<br />
    Quite a change from the wireless phone next to it. I just couldn&#8217;t resist buying that old phone even though it doesn&#8217;t work, but that is a future project.</p>

					<p>A friend was cleaning out some of his junk and found some old car magazines. He had little interest in them so he brought them to me. I traded some old model cars for them, as I enjoy reading old magazines and looking at the pictures.<br />
Later going through them I spotted the Vol, 1, No. 1 printed on the top.  Needless to say I became a bit excited as the magazine is in near perfect condition.. This was like taking a trip back in time.The magazine is short, just 23 pages, but full of interesting pictures. Even the ads are fun to read.<br />
I have read Hot Rod Magazine off and on for most of my life but this is a little before my time. I really didn&#8217;t get into cars till the mid 1950s, Anyway, saving them all would have been impossible.<br />
I have no idea of its value or if many of these have survived. I would be interested if anyone could tell me more about this Magazine.<br />
Just learned it is a reproduction done about 1987&#8212;-Oh well it is still interesting. I am still curious if it has any value.</p>

					<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-489" title="Mallory _A" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mallory-_A-300x225.jpg" alt="Mallory _A" width="300" height="225" /> This is my old Mallory model 12RS6D power supply. It is one of the handiest things I have at my work bench. It provides either 6 volts at 10 amp or 12 volts at 6 amp.  Up to 20 Amp intermittently. What makes it even better is the voltage is variable. Adjustable from nothing to about 15 volts.  Very handy when playing with things.</p>
<p>It is very old. I bought it in the 1980&#8242;s, at the auction sale of the contents of an old radio repair shop. This was at the the small neighbouring town of Olivia. I have been unable to come up with a date for manufacture, but I would guess the 1940&#8242;s at the latest. If some one could supply me  with more information on this unit, I would be appreciative.</p>
<p>The only complaint I have about the unit is, it is easy to forget the power on. With no light on it, you have to notice which way the toggle switch is sitting. Last week with the snow blowing outside and the wind chill below zero, (that&#8217;s about minus 18 degrees Celsius), I decided this would be a good project.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-491" title="Mallory_C" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mallory_C-300x217.jpg" alt="Mallory_C" width="300" height="217" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-490" title="mallory_B" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_B-300x253.jpg" alt="mallory_B" width="300" height="253" /></p>
<p>Turning the unit over, the job looked simple.</p>
<p>Digging in my junk (supplies) I came up with a red LED and snap in mounting ring.<br />
I like the simplicity of the design, no bottom cover to get in the way. I can relate to the feeling, if your stupid enough to stick your fingers into the wires, that&#8217;s Darwin in action. Note the heat sinks for the rectifiers is the steel case. I like the louvers on the top of the case, had to be designed by a Street Rodder. Common sense, open bottom, louvres on top&#8212;no need for a fan.<br />
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-492" title="mallory_D" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_D-300x225.jpg" alt="mallory_D" width="300" height="225" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-493" title="mallory_E" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_E-300x225.jpg" alt="mallory_E" width="300" height="225" />Digging through my stuff I came up with some goodies.</p>
<p>In the days before computers and calculators we used things like this paper slide rule.This one was given away by the Omite Co. of Chicago.<br />
I know that a LED has to have a resistor of the right size in series to keep from burning out. I did my calculations, but being it has been a while since doing anything like this. I did the reasonable thing and got on the Internet. Soon I had all the numbers, that left me feeling good as my calculations were right on. This old man isn&#8217;t dead yet.<br />
Luck was with me again as I found a new resister of the right value in my stash of spare parts. <strong>See</strong> just because something hasn&#8217;t been used for 20, 30 or more years doesn&#8217;t mean you should discard it.<br />
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-494" title="mallory_F" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_F-300x225.jpg" alt="mallory_F" width="300" height="225" /><br />
I wanted to be sure all would work right so I set up a quick test to check it out. All worked as planned, easier to find out you looked at something wrong at this point then after it is all assembled. This is where the various colored jumpers with alligator clips come in very handy.</p>
<p>Sorry about all stuff in the background, I never seem to be able to clear my bench completely.<br />
A gentleman with a better education than me, said as he smiled, that a man&#8217;s workbench reflects his mind. I pointed out that being his workbench was seldom used and almost empty, it told a lot about his mind too.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-495" title="mallory_G" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_G-300x225.jpg" alt="mallory_G" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-496" title="mallory_H" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mallory_H-300x225.jpg" alt="mallory_H" width="300" height="225" /> Here we are drilling the hole for the LED. Notice how heavy the steel in the case is, no skimping here. When this power supply was built, a battery powered electric drill was unbelievable. Electric drills were bulky, heavy, expensive and only starting to become common.<br />
Below you can see the LED from inside the case. The connections were simple solder jobs. The other picture shows the finished job. It doesn&#8217;t look much different but the red glowing LED will sure help remind me to shut the switch off.<br />

					<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-458" title="A_Blizard_2011" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/A_Blizard_2011.JPG" alt="A_Blizard_2011" width="1000" height="750" />This what winter in Minnesota sometimes looks like. I&#8217;m standing on the county blacktop road in front of my place. As you can see there is no problem with traffic for taking pictures. I think the wind was gusting to about 35 mph with the temp below zero Fahrenheit. I couldn&#8217;t say for sure if it was snowing because all the snow was moving side ways.</p>
<p>When I went back inside, the words of a friend Clarence Mages, came to me. &#8220;Rod even the ducks know enough to go south when it turns cold&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t long we had the car loaded, the heat turned down, water shut off and the other details taken care of. We headed south without a plan. No schedule, no timetable, Just some cash and a credit card.</p>
<p>By the time we got to Arkansas it was comfortable in shirt sleves. We stopped at antique stores, junk shops and whatever caught our eye. below are pictures of a custom 49 Ford I looked at.The light was wrong for picture taking but two did turn out. He had many projects under way and some really cool customs. If you ever get to Mena AR stop at LAWRY&#8217;S USED CAR&#8217;s and check it out.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-464" title="E_49_ford_Arkansaw" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/E_49_ford_Arkansaw-300x225.jpg" alt="E_49_ford_Arkansaw" width="300" height="225" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-465" title="F_49_ford_C" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/F_49_ford_C-300x208.jpg" alt="F_49_ford_C" width="300" height="208" /><br />
That Ford body was on a S-10, using the chassis, engine, drive train,dash, firewall, controls and much of the interior. The rear of the Ford body was extended to match the longer wheel base.<br />
We found warm weather for a couple of days in Galveston, TX.<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-459" title="AA_Galveston_A" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AA_Galveston_A-300x225.jpg" alt="AA_Galveston_A" width="300" height="225" /> We took a boat ride on a paddle wheel boat in the bay as the gulf was too rough. I and Donna enjoyed walking in the historic district, touring old houses and checking out the antique shops. Than as the weather cooled we headed down to South Padre Island. We had a few day of beautiful weather and enjoyed walking the beach. Our room had a balcony over looking the gulf and the sun rises were beautiful. Then the temp dropped to 28 degrees one night and the rain turned to sleet. the only bridge to the island was closed, The help couldn&#8217;t get to work in the hotel. They had 15 minuet rolling black out at random intervals, so people would get stuck in the hotel elevators at times. We had about a quarter to one half inch of ice on things, I don&#8217;t think it would have been noticed in MN. Brownsville shut everything down for two days.<br />
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-460" title="B_South_Padre_sun_2011" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/B_South_Padre_sun_2011-300x225.jpg" alt="B_South_Padre_sun_2011" width="300" height="225" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-469" title="C_South_Padre_2011" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/C_South_Padre_2011-300x211.jpg" alt="C_South_Padre_2011" width="300" height="211" /><br />
Called a friend at home the morning it was 28 degrees. He told me it was 35 degrees and the sun was                                          shinning in MN.</p>
<p><img class="align left size-medium wp-image-463" title="D_South_Padre_ice_2011" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/D_South_Padre_ice_2011-300x224.jpg" alt="D_South_Padre_ice_2011" width="300" height="224" /> Yes we still walked the beach when it turned cold and the wind was gusting to 28 MPH. I was amazed the sand drifted like snow and I liked the sound of the gulf. This is a picture we took on the beach the morning after the Ice storm.<br />
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-462" title="Donna_and_Gene_2011A" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Donna_and_Gene_2011A1-300x225.jpg" alt="Donna_and_Gene_2011A" width="300" height="225" /><br />
After wandering around for a bit we headed over to Jay, Florida. Donna&#8217;s brother Gene and sister Doreen live in that aria. Her brother has been fighting cancer. We wanted to see how he was doing. As the picture shows he looks great.<br />
Back home again the weather looks about the same as when we left.<br />
We had a great time but it is good to be home again</p>

<p>We are having an old fashioned winter. So I have been spending most of my spare time in the lab where it is nice and warm. My wife wanted the old Apple out of the house as it had been taking up storage space for years. Looking at it again brought back fond memories. I just had to set it up again to see if it would still run. I couldn&#8217;t bear to pack it up and hide it away. It was an amazing machine in it&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>The year we acquired it, my son Jeremy was in Jr High and was very interested in computers. We had an  Apple II my sister had sold me. He put a lot of hours in on that old machine. The Principle of his school took me aside and told me I really needed to buy a  new Apple GS  for Jeremy. He said it would be an investment in Jeremy&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>My son had been talking about how great a machine the GS was, as he had limited access to one in school. I checked on price and was told a little better than two grand. That was a lot of money for the family at that time. Farming hadn&#8217;t been going well, I was working part time and had started a small retailing business.</p>
<p>I told Jeremy that if gross receipts exceeded X amount for the coming season we would buy the new GS. What followed was a fabulous summer vending, our sales were well ahead of the year before. I say our sales, because Jeremy was very active in the business. He was a master salesman.</p>
<p>Needless to say we picked that Apple GS up in Willmar that fall. Complete with a color Monitor, extra memory, a 5.25 inch floppy disc drive (remember those), a 3.5 inch disc drive, and  a dot matrix printer. With the tax it was over 3,000 bucks.</p>
<p>We both put in a lot of time on that machine, it was a world ahead of the Apple II. I even started doing books for the business on it. It was a good buy for the time. We put lots of hours on it, so the price per hour wasn&#8217;t bad. He even took it to college his first year  but times were changing fast. My son got a Mac lap top and the GS stayed home in my office.</p>
<p>After college my son worked in the computer world, Anderson Enterprises  kept growing.  Machines  came out that had hard drives, Internet access ,were faster, bigger and much cheaper. So we moved on.</p>
<p>The GS seems primitive now. Back then it was state of the art. The first home computer with graphic operating system and a mouse. Windows copied much from Apple.</p>
<p>I set it up so my grand kids can see this antique work and play a game or two. I like to look at it too.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We were blessed with plentiful rain in the summer and we are blessed<br />
with plentiful snow this winter.  What a difference a season makes!<br />
Hope you enjoy seeing the difference.</p>
<p>The 10 inches today was beautiful and very fluffy, it was also much<br />
warmer today, up in the 20&#8242;s.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful Holiday Season.</p>
<p>Donna</p>
