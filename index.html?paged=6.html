<div id="attachment_394" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 1034px"><img class="size-large wp-image-394" title="silo9" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/silo9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Down she goes" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Down she goes</p></div>
<p>The end of an era, after standing for over 75 years (maybe 85) the corn silo came down. My Father and Grandfather had it built for the storage of corn silage by the Svea Silo Co. of Svea, Minnesota. It was constructed of pre-stressed concrete blocks called staves. One edge was concave and the opposed edge was convex. They would be set together and steel bands were tightened around the structure to hold it together. A coat of cement was painted on the inside to make it air tight.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-392" title="Horses and old barn" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Horses-and-old-barn-226x300.jpg" alt="Horses and old barn" width="226" height="300" />This old photo shows the barn and silo and the last of Dad&#8217;s work horses. This probably dates from early 1940&#8242;s. Sadly not many photos were taken of farm operations and fewer survived.</p>
<p>Green corn was chopped, stalk and all, into inch long pieces and blown into the silo from the top. Many tons of this would pack down into the structure and ferment, thereby preserving the nutrients in the corn.<br />
Back then Dad milked 12 cows or so. The 14 by 36 foot silo was enough to take care of the animals all winter. We would dig it out by hand and carry it to the cows in a bushel basket twice a day.<br />
Dad sold his cows in the early 60&#8242;s and the silo went unused. The small family farm was no longer financially viable and by the 70&#8242;s it became apparent it never would be again.</p>
<p>The unused barn was disassembled for lumber salvage in the 1970&#8242;s and it&#8217;s cement floor and foundations buried in the early 90&#8242;s. At that time the cost of disposal of the silo far exceeded the gain the additional crop land would return. This year, the higher corn prices, plus the danger of the structure collapsing into a growing crop and the difficulty of the larger farm machinery manoeuvring around the structure, made us move forward.</p>
<p>The traditional way of taking a silo down was to take the steel bands off the bottom. Then take a sledge hammer, break the cement staves out till it starts to fall, then run like hell. I just didn&#8217;t like that part about running. My son, Jeremy, came up with the idea of shooting the staves out with a high power rifle. When the crop was out we gathered some spectators and the fun began.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-395" title="Silo_11" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Silo_11-300x225.jpg" alt="Silo_11" width="300" height="225" /> Here we are getting ready.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the left, next is an old friend, Dan Pederson, My sister Margaret (or Peg as I always knew her). Ronna and Dave Gravgard in background.</p>
<p>Jeremy showing his AR15 rifle.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-393" title="silo2" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/silo2-300x168.jpg" alt="silo2" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>Here is Jeremy with a fresh load of ammunition. Good thing he brought plenty along. It would take many shots to break through. Notice how the staves are shot out more than half way around and the silo is still standing.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-404" title="Silo_on the ground" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Silo_on-the-ground-222x300.jpg" alt="Silo_on the ground" width="222" height="300" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-403" title="Silo_all thats left" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Silo_all-thats-left-300x225.jpg" alt="Silo_all thats left" width="300" height="225" /> When it went, it went fast and it fell in a different direction than I would have guessed. I&#8217;m glad I was clear.</p>
<p>The concrete has gone for recycling. I separated the iron and got it out of the field. next spring I will sell it for scrap Iron, unless I can find someone who needs 5/8 inch steel rod.<br />
I hired a large hoe to bury the foundation. He wasn&#8217;t sure when he would get there and I didn&#8217;t need to be there. So I just figured I would  listen for him and get some pictures. I was working in my shop when I heard him. He was done and loading up again before I walked down to him, so I failed get pictures. The land has been returned to a level field again. In a few years know one will remember it was ever there.</p>

I think it is quite old because of the label &#8220;hard oil&#8221; instead of the word grease being used. I tried searching for the Kunz oil co. of Mpls. without much luck. Maybe I&#8217;ll find something with a little more time invested. If any one has any information on the age of this can I would appreciate hearing from you.</p>

In my usual fashion, I sped ahead without checking the building code for the spacing of uprights.   We were unable to use it because of this . I set the thing aside in my shop, wondering what to do with it. My wife, Donna spotted it while she was doing her gardens. Being clever and artistic she came up with a neat use for it.</p>
<p>The picture above shows her west garden which is one of many. This one is secluded behind the house and was carved from the brush.  I think they look interesting and attractive there. Hopefully they will cause the deer to detour around the garden.  As the spring progresses and the flowers grow, the garden will look even more beautiful.</p>

I would have a hard time getting along without it. It is an antique, believe it or not. Manufactured in 1959, the year I graduated from high school. I purchased it for $1100  on an auction sale in the 1970&#8242;s when I bought dad&#8217;s farm. That same year my wife went to an auction in the neighborhood that had listed a heavy duty loader. With advice from a cousin, my wife joined the bidding. Now we we were newly back in the area and only the relatives and a few neighbors new Donna. When she called out her bid everyone turned and looked to see who this attractive young lady was. A woman bidding on a tractor loader was in itself unusual. The sale of the item was forgotten as they asked each other who was this stranger. You could here the whispers, &#8220;oh dat must be George Anderson&#8217;s  Daughter-in-law, ya sure, she next to Pete Peterson an dat would be her cousin den&#8221;. The Auctioneer knew it was over, called sold for $220 to the young Lady. The men turned there attention back to the sale, with more than one regretting they had been distracted.  I rebuilt the mount to fit the 340 and the result is a loader much stronger than the tractor.</P></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-302" title="B_old_exaust" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/05/B_old_exaust-300x130.jpg" alt="B_old_exaust" width="300" height="130" /> Time takes it toll on everything, no big deal just buy some new parts, simple. You Bet, not on a 1959 tractor.  No longer available, a problem Hot Roders and car restorers run into all the time.  Making the pipe was the easy part. Rule&#8217;s tire in Willmar was able to bent me a copy.The result is below, I had to tweak the pipe a bit by heating it with my old acetylene torch. Yaa, I know The power bender does a nicer job. Normally you have the unit your working on, next to the bender so its easy to do.  I&#8217;m ten miles from town and I didn&#8217;t want to run back and forth or haul the tractor.</P></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" title="C_new Pipe" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/05/C_new-Pipe-300x233.jpg" alt="C_new Pipe" width="300" height="233" /> The problem came with the muffler. No one had one on hand that would fit. ordering was a possibility.Searching the parts books for dimensions and pipe size is a pain in the butt. Plus that all takes time. I wanted to use the tractor, so the thought of a straight pipe entered my mind. Not a good idea, I  knew my hearing was already bad enough.</P></p>
<p>In the corner of the shed I spotted an old muffler from a motorcycle. I knew I had a cool solution. With a little hack saw work and my gas welder, I fabricated up a tolerable system.  [[edit from jeremy:  the muffler is half of a 4-into-2 Supertrapp system from a 1984 VF750F Interceptor]]</p>
<p>View the pictures below I know the tractor needs new paint, that with some work it would be pretty again, buts that&#8217;s down the road. With summer coming that means cruises and fun so getting the red convertible ready is first.</p>
<p>In the mean time you don&#8217;t often see custom exhaust like this on a tractor.</p>

					<p>I must brag a bit. Here is my son Jeremy and my grandsons Thorwald and Gunnar on the stump of the old Ash tree we took out of the flower bed just south of the house. It is early march but the weather was very nice. My son and Thor were just here for the day but Gunnar stayed for a couple of days .</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-291" title="IMG_9916E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_9916E.JPG" alt="IMG_9916E" width="445" height="559" /></p>

<p>I like this picture of Thor. He mastered his fear of heights and climbed up (and down) onto the loft in my pole barn.  I showed him how to make sure his hold was secure on the steps, move one hand or one foot at a time, and keep your weight close to the latter. Don&#8217;t be ashamed of fear  because it makes you careful, just don&#8217;t let it paralyse you. Think before your every move and all will be fine. Living in the Big City the Boys don&#8217;t have the opportunity to climb and explore like I did growing up on the farm in the 40&#8242;s and 50&#8242;s<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-290" title="Gunnar  E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Gunnar-E--300x226.jpg" alt="Gunnar  E" width="300" height="226" />. Life was a continuous adventure with minimal supervision. I survived the cuts and bruises and gained confidence and respect for danger.</p>
<p>Here is Gunnar all ready to drive Grandpa&#8217;s garden tractor. He has the hearing protection on and note the smile. Gunnar loves to be with Grandpa in the garages and shop on the farm. He does think that Grandpa should either fix or get rid of the rusty junk that he has accumulated in the corners. Below is a young man taking driving very  seriously.</p>

					<p>Recently my trusty old belt of 20 some years wore out. I priced belts in several  clothing store&#8217;s and about went into shock. Forty dollars for a plain strip of leather B.S. Even the discount stores were over priced. Now I admit I needed to be able to change buckles easily as I prefer my own buckle. That should have lowered the price as I didn&#8217;t need a buckle. Instead it lowered selection greatly.</p>
<p>Fate smiled on me as I was walking through a Flee Market in Mobile Alabama last February.  Off to the back of his display were the two belts shown below. Inquiring, the vendor pointed out that both had problems. One was missing the buckle and the other had a blemish in the leather. I looked them over while trying hard to show disappointment in my face. This was somewhat difficult as these belts were perfect for what I needed. I pointed out that because he was such a pleasant fellow I would help him out by taking these useless items off his hands and pay him a couple of dollars. He pointed out he had paid dearly for these new belts and that they were of premium leather. After several minutes of discussion we arrived at a compromise of less than five dollars for the two.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-275" title="A_9811E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/A_9811E-150x150.jpg" alt="A_9811E" width="150" height="150" /> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-276" title="B_9813E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/B_9813E-150x150.jpg" alt="B_9813E" width="150" height="150" /> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-277" title="C_9815E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/C_9815E-150x150.jpg" alt="C_9815E" width="150" height="150" /> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-278" title="D_9817E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/D_9817E-150x150.jpg" alt="D_9817E" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Above are the belts and my favourite buckle. As you can see the belts  are too long and have no way to attach the buckle. I determined the belt length I needed by slipping the buckle on the belt and holding the belt around me. Than I clamped the belt as you can see in the next picture. On the work bench are  some snaps that I had purchased in the late 1980&#8242;s for fixing leather jackets. Next I used my trusty sharpie and a small ruler to mark the spot.  Note the awl I used to center punch the spot for drilling. It is made from  a worn out Philips screwdriver, the large handle make it great to handle. I used a freshly sharpened metal bit for drilling the holes.</p>
<p>Below I crimp the snaps in place note I installed the first snap before I made the hole for the second snap. That way alignment is guaranteed. I use a piece of quarter inch scrap steel  that is 1.25 by 6 inches to protect the desk top that I use for a work bench. The snaps are riveted in with a special punch so the protection is needed. all that&#8217;s left, is to mark  and cut the extra off.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-279" title="E_9814E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/E_9814E-150x150.jpg" alt="E_9814E" width="150" height="150" /> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-280" title="F_9818E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/F_9818E-150x150.jpg" alt="F_9818E" width="150" height="150" /> <strong>The finished product</strong> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-281" title="G_9823E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/G_9823E-150x150.jpg" alt="G_9823E" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Not a big deal of a project but I have a new work belt for a couple of bucks and some fun. I did this all a month ago but spring came early so I did not get around to finishing this till now.</p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, I didn&#8217;t win the Bull Riding buckle in some long ago competition, when I was young and tough. I&#8217;ll admit I have spun a few late night stories to acquaintance&#8217;s, they were ment solely for entertainment. The truth is I acquired a lot of  them back when I was selling on the circuit. The thing that always  got me in trouble was, &#8220;how much would they be if I took them all&#8221;. If you feel a need for a few ( or several), get in touch with me. all are serial numbered, limited edition, vintage 1980&#8242;s.</p>

It reminded me of the way city&#8217;s were in the 1950s. The weather was great, with lots of sun shine. The town is full of tourists from all over the world and  I really enjoyed visiting with people.  My only regret is that I didn&#8217;t have my red convertible down there to ride around in.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful and interesting  things I could write about and I will add more later. Here I am at the end of the day, isn&#8217;t the sun set grand.                                                                                                                                                                                  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-264" title="img_9654E" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/02/img_9654E.jpg" alt="img_9654E" width="1000" height="750" /></p>

					<p><strong>This is my latest project as it looked on completion. </strong> My son found a deal on a nice mount bracket that takes little table room. we ran into a problem as you can see</p>
<div id="attachment_228" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-228" title="aIMG_8992" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/aIMG_8992-300x225.jpg" alt="dual mount monitures" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">dual mount monitures</p></div>
<p>from the following pictures. the new brackets are made to hold a monitor from the center of the back and these monitors had a mount point on the lower edge with very different mounting holes.         I would have needed longer screws if I had modified the new mount bracket. Also the mount seemed a bit unstable that way. (I did try). Rather than drive the 10 miles into town and search for Chinese metric screws I decided go the rout shown below. I knew that would be sturdy plus I could use what I had on hand.</p>
<dl id="attachment_228" style="width: 316px;">
<dt><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-229" title="aIMG_9013 (copy)" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/aIMG_9013-copy-150x150.jpg" alt="aIMG_9013 (copy)" width="150" height="150" />This is the original mount that took up much desk space and was a bit unstable </dt>
</dl>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-230" title="BIMG_8891" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/BIMG_8891-150x150.jpg" alt="BIMG_8891" width="150" height="150" /> <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-231" title="CIMG_8890" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CIMG_8890-150x150.jpg" alt="CIMG_8890" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-232" title="dIMG_8892" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/dIMG_8892-150x150.jpg" alt="dIMG_8892" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-233" title="eIMG_8893 (copy)" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/eIMG_8893-copy-150x150.jpg" alt="eIMG_8893 (copy)" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Above is the new mount as you can see,  it is very different where it attaches to the monitor. Next shows the 3/16  sheet  iron plate I made to attach to the monitor, next is the new mount bracket and the 3/16 thick sheet  iron I used, The iron I used is all salvage, cut from junk or left over from projects. The last picture in the row is finished plate with the holes drilled to match the new mount bracket, note the marker and the up arrow on the iron plate. Nothing worse than to spend the time to cut and drill a piece and then to turn it wrong on the welding table and screw it up permanently. Easy to do with grey pencil marks on grey iron or trusting your eyes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-234" title="FIMG_8906" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/FIMG_8906-150x150.jpg" alt="FIMG_8906" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-235" title="HIMG_8894" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/HIMG_8894-150x150.jpg" alt="HIMG_8894" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-236" title="JIMG_8896" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/JIMG_8896-150x150.jpg" alt="JIMG_8896" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-237" title="LIMG_8900" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/LIMG_8900-150x150.jpg" alt="LIMG_8900" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>On the left above is the one inch by 1/4 iron bar on the anvil with the hammer that shaped it. The bar is also from my junk pile, much stronger than needed, but it is what I found quickly  on a cold winter day. The anvil was my fathers and I think my Grandfathers, which makes it over a 100 years old.  Even though  its shows its age it&#8217;s perfect for shaping iron with a hammer. I wonder if my Grandfather, when he hammered out plow shares or shaped horse shoes on it, could ever have imagined what I used it for today.</p>
<p>The next picture shows laying out the irons to determine the size. On this type of project I find it best to constantly check for size and fit. The third picture shows the iron cut to size and marks for  fit up.  Next we are back to the welding table, because I was concerned about alignment I clamped the pieces down. My weld isn&#8217;t the most beautiful work that I have done but my welding shop is unheated.  The lens in my helmet would fog up even if I held my breath. You need to see the puddle of molten metal to make a good weld and so I erred on the safe side by letting the puddle get a bit high.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-238" title="MIMG_8904" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/MIMG_8904-150x150.jpg" alt="MIMG_8904" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-239" title="NIMG_8905" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/NIMG_8905-150x150.jpg" alt="NIMG_8905" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-240" title="OIMG_8908" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OIMG_8908-150x150.jpg" alt="OIMG_8908" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-241" title="PIMG_8913" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PIMG_8913-150x150.jpg" alt="PIMG_8913" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>No problem with some extra weld metal, the big hand grinder takes it down fast. You can barley see my nine inch yellow grinder in back of the vice.  The second picture shows us back inside checking alignment again. Than back to the welding shop  and forming a matching bracket for the second monitor. They must be the same to look right. the last picture in the above line shows the jig I made to hold parts in line for welding and to assure that the brackets match.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-242" title="QIMG_8909" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/QIMG_8909-150x150.jpg" alt="QIMG_8909" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-243" title="RIMG_8910" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/RIMG_8910-150x150.jpg" alt="RIMG_8910" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-244" title="SIMG_8915" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/SIMG_8915-150x150.jpg" alt="SIMG_8915" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-245" title="UIMG_8918E" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/UIMG_8918E-150x150.jpg" alt="UIMG_8918E" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Above you can see all the metal work is done. In the next picture  we try it and it looks &#8221; good enough for a town this size&#8221;. It is  now safe to finish the second bracket.  Next we take things apart and hang the brackets up and paint them as you can see in the third photo. Because it is cold outside, I paint in the wash room in the lab which get pretty strong smelling . I did have an exhaust fan set up but that blows too much heat out. The solution I have found best is to paint it than go for coffee.</p>
<p>The forth shows the finished brackets final attachment to the monitor, almost factory looking.</p>
<p>Below is the finale test mount. Next to it is the finished product, very stable as it is clamped to the table.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-246" title="VIMG_8924" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/VIMG_8924-150x150.jpg" alt="VIMG_8924" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-256" title="2009-12-22 13.11.42" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009-12-22-13.11.42-150x150.jpg" alt="2009-12-22 13.11.42" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p><strong> Below is my Son and Grandson enjoying the finished setup.</strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-247" title="wIMG_8989E" src="wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wIMG_8989E.JPG" alt="wIMG_8989E" width="810" height="608" /></p>
<p>The cost of the project? Two 6013 welding rods, A couple pounds of scrap iron, some spray paint and bolts from my junk drawer.  Less than the cost of a good cup of java, plus a bit of time.</p>

					<p>The first Saterday of each month the <strong>Willmar Car Club</strong> has a breakfast get together.  Nothing formal, it&#8217;s a gathering of people from all walks of life who like cars.  If its nice we drive our rides. If our ride isn&#8217;t running or it is still in the dream stage we come anyway, and join the conversation. I always enjoy the stories people tell, and I have found most car people like to talk about cars. Check the locations and schedule at the following link, then drop in and join us, you will be welcome.  www.willmarcarclub.com/calendar.htm</p>
<p>Now we always have lots of door prizes which adds to the fun. As you can see from the following picture, some are extra nice.  The way we do things, a table is filled with prizes and each lucky person gets to chose the one they like best.</p>
<p>The last Breakfast, Lady Luck smiled on me. My name was the first name drawn, so I had first choice. Check the picture below and note the <strong>headlight bezel clock</strong> on my shop wall. Sharp isn&#8217;t it, can you name the car it came from?</p>
<p>These are hand made by Brian Pearson of New London MN. They are not cheap plastic but solid metal,  made from the real headlight bezels. He makes a wide variety and can be reached at pearsongs@charter.net. Brian also does some other interesting things. Check this site  at www.aabaca.com/pearsong.html</p>

					<p>I just attended my 50 year class reunion this week end. I had a good time and it brought back lots of memories. Out of a class of about 260 their were, I&#8217;m guessing, some over 110 members present. A good turnout but it was somewhat disappointing that a lot of the people I chumed around with weren&#8217;t there. I ran with the guys that liked cars. and most of my friends joined the blue collar world after school.<br />
It was an impressive bunch at the banquet, preachers, lawyers, engineers, professors. Many people with impressive resumes. I&#8217;m proud to have known them and it was fun visiting with everyone. Probably best was the forgotten memory&#8217;s it brought back.  It made me think hard about my life and the choices I have made.<br />
School was tolerable, but hardly the best time of my life, I was eager to move on. I got pretty good grades but almost never studied. I had some good teachers and I enjoyed those classes. Then their was Russ the coach who could make an interesting subject like history unbelievably dull. I loved to read, still do, read all my text books cover to cover by the end of the first quarter.<br />
I received about six and one half percent of my education in high school the rest of my education has been spread over the my life time. I found that education costs money whether you get it in the &#8220;Halls of Ivy&#8221; or on the street as I did.<br />
I am satisfied with the way life turned out and I wouldn&#8217;t trade with anyone. I would be the first to admit I made a lot of mistakes and did a few stupid things. Even if I could I wouldn&#8217;t go back and change a thing, it might screw up the end result. I have traveled as much as I desire, Europe, all 50 States and Canada. Along the way I learned I would rather listen to people, than instruct them. I have found most people are friendly, weather on the streets of London, or New York, or a small town in rural America, and if you do find a hostile person, its not you they are angry at, but the problems in their own life. One thing is certain they all have interesting stories to tell.<br />
I have been very fortunate in that my best friend in life is my wife of almost 48 years. I have a great family, My two children have done much better in life then I ever did, all this in a world that is much more difficult. I believe my grand children are very capable and are being well equipped to deal with the future.<br />
As for the future, I have been hearing that the world is &#8220;going to hell in a hand basket&#8221; as long as I can remember. It was always from old people and it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  I&#8217;ll admit I feel that way myself sometimes but then I think how good I have it. I believe that feeling is just a symptom of old age and the fear of change.<br />
That the world is changing there  is no doubt. Some change is bad,  some is good but most is just different. Change is also opportunity, as a fellow I worked for pointed out to me. The cruel fact is No one looses money without some one else gaining it.<br />
If anyone from the class of &#8220;59&#8243; reads this, I would be happy to hear from you. Conversation is something I truly enjoy.   E-Mail me at rodander@frontiernet.net</p>
