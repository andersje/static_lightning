					<p>This is Sesame Street Cookie Munster Popper Game by Lewco. Corporation. It Has a 1988 copy right date.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-cookie-Munster-toy-.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1348" title="A cookie Munster toy" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-cookie-Munster-toy--300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" /></a>I have the three Cookie Munster toys and the 17 cookies that go with them. They are about 8 inches high and I think they look really neat.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-cookie-munster-toy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1349" title="B cookie munster toy" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-cookie-munster-toy-300x251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a><br />
They are clean and show little or no wear. I have no boxes or instructions for them. They are made to play with by pushing the bottom of the cookie jar down to where it catches. You then take turns putting the cookies in till the bottom pops up. That makes the cookies fly out. They do work but I have no idea how long they are suppose to stay down and they are old. I have thought of making a real cookie jar out of one of them or maybe a planter for flowers. I know they are too good to throw away. I am asking $10.00 for the three of them, plus postage. I will always consider offers. You can reach me at frontiernet.net. I do accept PayPal also.</p>

It is dated 1984 and is packed in a catalog order box. The box is in poor condition from age and none of the inside packing is there.<br />
The Instructions are included and from them I was able to check the contents. Everything is there and as you can see from the pictures. Most of the parts are still on their plastic trees.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/C-Tonka-GoBots-.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1318" title="C Tonka GoBots" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/C-Tonka-GoBots--300x232.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="232" /></a><br />

The plastic parts are in very good condition. I have repacked every thing in bags to keep it nice and to prevent loss. The Decal sheet looks good but it has some wrinkles from being loose in the box for so many years. I have packed it tight, between two pieces of clean flat cardboard. That will prevent further wrinkles and hopefully improve it.<br />
I have considered assembling and displaying this item in my lab but I just don&#8217;t have the room.<br />
I am asking <strong>$50.00</strong> plus Postage for it. I do accept PayPal. I can be reached at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net</strong></p>

					<p>I dug out this Touch Down Pinball game. It is a Tiger Electronics model 7-923 with a copy right date on box of 1988.  However the box had a slip marked 11/29/89 in the box.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Touchdown-Pinball.jpg"><img src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Touchdown-Pinball-279x300.jpg" alt="" title="A Touchdown Pinball" width="279" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1297" /></a><br />
 The box has very attractive graphics as you can see in the pictures below. It is in nice condition with a little wear on edges and some tape damage on ends. It works well and sounds much like the old pinball machines.<br />
It looks nearly new with only a few small scratches in the plastic. Itis packed in its original box with all parts and instructions.  I don&#8217;t think it was ever played with much. This is an unusual old toy in very good condition. I think it would make a neat display piece.<br />
 I am asking $19.00 for it plus whatever the cost of postage is. I can accept PayPal.<br />

					<p>I have a JVC digital video camera model no. GR-D30V. It says 700X digital zoom, 16X optical zoom, 520 resolution. I have the battery and the charger but no tape.

The camera is clean and looks good. I had planned to repair it myself, so I have been saving it for a couple of years. I have decided this is beyond my ability and ambition. I do not have the owners manual but that is available on line.<br />

<p>I have two Vonage D-Link broadband telephone adapters. The first is brand new sealed in its plastic box with all accessory&#8217;s.  It is labeled internet phone service and starter kit The original price tag is on it yet, stating $49.99.</p>
<p>The second was used and has no package and no instruction book. I will include the phone cable. They are both Model VTA-VR .<br />
My son used the system for a time in his business and had the new one as a spare.</p>
<p>I contemplated adopting this phone system. I figured it wasn&#8217;t worth the effort for this old man to learn something new.</p>
<p>They have been on my shelf for over a year. I really know very little about them, so it is now time for me to sell them.<br />
I will sell both for $35.00 plus postage. I would be open to offers as I need to move them along. I do accept PayPal. Contact me at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net</strong><br />

					<p>The Simpson&#8217;s My Story of Life board game. Made in USA by Cardinal Industry&#8217;s. It has the number 4300 on it and a copyright date of 1990.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Simpsons-game.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1243" title="A Simpsons game" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Simpsons-game-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a><br />
The graphics on box are neat and the condition is good. There is one small nick on box front. The physical condition of the box is very good.<br />
The playing board looks new. From its appearance, I don&#8217;t think it has ever been played on.<br />
The cards have not been separated from the sheet they were printed on as you can see from the pictures below. This is good assurance that none are missing.<br />
The instruction sheet is included and doesn&#8217;t look like it has had much handling.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-Simpson-Game-.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1246" title="B Simpson Game" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-Simpson-Game--300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" /></a><br />

<p>I unfolded the sheet the cards are printed on in the picture on the left below.</p>
<p>The photo below and on the right shows the only shortcoming of the set. The only thing punched out is the <strong>Bart Simpson figure and he is missing </strong>. Even the stand for him is still here. It makes one wonder what the story behind this is.<br />
As you can see the stands and the dice are sealed in their bag. The paper money is still bound in its pad.<br />
The figures of the Simpsons are very glossy. My picture does not do them Justice. They are really quite clear and nice. This old man will have to work at learning how to take better picture.<br />

I am asking $19.00 plus postage and insurance for the game. I will consider offers. I do now accept PayPal. I can be reached at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net.</strong></p>

					<p>This is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pizza Power box Game by MIRAGE STUDIOS copyright 1987. Below is the pictures of the box. The Box is sturdy and the graphics on the front are fairly good. There is one small scar on the front cover. As you can see the surface of back of the box has some ripples  but the picture still looks quite good.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Turtles-Game.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1210" title="A Turtles Game" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-Turtles-Game-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="147" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-Turtles-Game.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1211" title="B Turtles Game" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-Turtles-Game-300x163.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="163" /></a><br />
The game doesn&#8217;t look like it was played with much. Below are the pictures of the game board and cards.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/E-Turtle-Board.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1213" title="E Turtle Board" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/E-Turtle-Board-300x255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/F-Turtle-Cards.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1215" title="F Turtle Cards" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/F-Turtle-Cards-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a><br />
There are 24 good guy cards and 20 bad guy cards. The four ninja Turtle figures also look new. The stands for the figures are included along with some plastic coins or markers.  I found no instructions but there was a content list printed on the outside of the box. The bad news is one plastic battle flipper and the Die are missing.</p>
<p>As you can see below I sealed the cards and small parts in plastic bags to keep them from getting lost. Unlike the picture the cards are all colored clearly and evenly. They are shiny and this old man just couldn&#8217;t get a clear picture.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/G-Turtle-Cards.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1220" title="G Turtle Cards" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/G-Turtle-Cards-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" /></a><br />

This is a very old game and it needs a good home.<br />

					<p>I upgraded my shop computer when I got a deal on a used Mother Board with a quad core AMD 64 processor. This board had a big cooler on it. Things worked out really well until I went to put the side on the case. <a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-problem-with-case.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1157" title="A problem with case" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-problem-with-case-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> As you can see the cooler is above the yard stick I am holding on the case. My first inclination was to change the case. Checking my junk, I found nothing that would work. Many things entered my mind, including leaving the cover off. My next option was cutting a hole in the cover and I didn&#8217;t care for that.<br />
My mind slipped back to my old Hot Rod days. I dug out my Ballpean hammer and a flat piece of iron to pound against. I was lucky, the cover was mild steel and worked easily. It was cold out at my welding table so I started in the lab where it is nice and warm. The picture below shows my efforts. You can see that I wasn&#8217;t getting a nice job with old hammer. I went out and dug through my tools. I came up with my car body repair tool I had purchased in the 1950&#8242;s.  A small hand held anvil and the flat body hammer.  In the days before Bondo, dents were worked out by hand. Iron can be stretched and shrunk if you have the right skills. I learned a bit but I never came close to the old timers. <a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D-shaping-case.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1162" title="D shaping case" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D-shaping-case-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/E-Shaping-case-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1163" title="E Shaping case 2" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/E-Shaping-case-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> You can see it taking shape. It was harder for me as the mesh area worked differently. The fact that it has been a few years since I have worked at something like this, had an effect. Though not perfect, I did get it &#8220;good enough for a town this size&#8221;. ( a favorite saying of a good friend I worked with back in the 1960&#8242;s)<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HA-test-fit.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1169" title="HA test fit" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HA-test-fit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HB-Finnished-case.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1170" title="HB  Finnished case" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HB-Finnished-case-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
The picture on the left shows my final trial fit. I had a minimum clearance of about a quarter inch .  I was tempted to stop at this point. I took the picture, but then decided the finish was too messed up for me to quit now. I took it off and sprayed it black. No one will notice it now but that is good. The amount of time I put in will never be talked about, but I proved to myself that I can still do a few things. I must say it was more fun than buying a new case.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A-scrap-project.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1068" title="A scrap project" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A-scrap-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
Over the years the old farm has collected stuff. Everything was saved that might be usable later. The last years I have been working to clean up the place. Metals need to be recycled, saleable things need to find there way to people that have a use for them.  I also look for things that tell me more about my brother, my father and my grandfather.<br />
The picture on the left shows the old truck van body my brother brought out here in the early 1970&#8242;s. Dad owned the farm at that time, and Phil, who worked in St.Paul, needed a place to store good stuff. It was full of all kinds of car, truck and old tractor parts. There were also old tools and farm things. By the time I bought the farm from Dad, the farm grove had grown thick around not only the old Van, but around the junk cars, old tractors and machinery. It was barely visible so it made very little difference.<br />
What was a good, weather tight storage unit had deteriorated over the years. My brother had also aged and lost both interest and energy to do anything with it, so it mainly sat undisturbed for the last 25 years.   The last ten years I kept a plastic tarp tied down on top to keep rain out. My brother thought that his sons would want all these good things. I remember the disappointment on his face when they stood here telling him there was nothing in there that they wanted. When My brother passed away, I became owner of all that good stuff. <a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/B-scrap-project.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1069" title="B scrap project" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/B-scrap-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
Over the years we have cleaned up the farm grove. Cutting up the dead and broken trees. Removing Buckthorn and planting grass. This made the Junk an eyesore, so one of my main retirement projects has been the clean up. This fall with my hog barn converted to good storage I started the Van clean up.  The next picture on left shows the inside of the van when I had it mostly empty. I regret not having taken more pictures. The Van was so full you couldn&#8217;t tell what was at the far end. It was a bigger project than I anticipated. Plastic pails, full of bolts and parts, turned to almost dust as you tried to move them. Cardboard boxes did the same. Field Mice had had a good home in there and years of dirt and dust had blown in. The wood floor of the Van had rotted away in places so carrying heavy things out was a bit touchy.<br />
I was never sure what was all in there so I turned down an offer from a scrap iron dealer to just haul it away.<br />
I hauled trailer loads to my shop, blew the dirt off with my air compressor, and then sorted  things. I didn&#8217;t find much good stuff, but it was an interesting project. Most things needed cleaning either with the wire wheel or the sand blaster to be sure what they were. Than copper, brass, iron, aluminium all needed to be sorted for scrap. Because time was slipping by, some bigger thing were just cleaned off and moved to storage to be dealt with next spring.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/C-srap-project.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1070" title="C srap project" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/C-srap-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/D-scrap-project.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1072" title="D scrap project" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/D-scrap-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
Many thing that had value once, were now deteriorated beyond use or just obsolete. Old bolts had always been saved because they were useful for fixing old farm machinery. Now they were rusty and of sizes that I will never use, so on to the iron dealer. I handled the small iron scrap by putting it in cleaned out empty one gallon paint pails. The small stuff could be shaken down tight, than the cover hammered on. This made handling easier, preventing the scattering of old nails and stuff.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-scrap-project.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1078" title="E scrap project" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-scrap-project-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hog-barn-inside-east.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1080" title="hog barn inside east" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hog-barn-inside-east-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
These last two pictures show the inside of my storage building. Hub caps have been hung on the wall for decoration. Also you can see the tail of Dads old wind generator from the 1930&#8242;s. We had no electric power on the farm, so the wind was used to charge a spare car battery so we could have radio.<br />
I still have much to deal with yet but I am making headway. Next spring all the old tractor parts will be gone. Where the van body stood will become lawn again.</p>

Back in 1979 I had this  Hog Barn built. It was state of the art, a well insulated building, automatic fans, augers to fill the feeders and feed in steel tanks that mice or rats could not get to. Slatted floors kept the hogs clean and liquid manure handling ended the day of the man with a shovel.<br />
I did well at first, but times changed. This system allowed farms to grow large and raise huge numbers of hogs. So profit margins got thinner and thinner. I had no desire to grow bigger and bigger, even though my banker recommended it. By the time I got the building paid for I rented it out. Nothing lasts forever and time took it&#8217;s toll on the building and equipment. By 2008 the building was too<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-hog-barn-at-start-west-end-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1017" title="E hog barn at start west end 2" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-hog-barn-at-start-west-end-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> small to be worth the high cost of renovating. You can see the deterioration in the photos. Normally the renter would pressure wash the inside of the building after every batch of hogs were sold. My thought at the time was that the building would be buried so washing was pointless. I sold the feed tanks right away, as they were still quite valuable. you can see in the picture that the tank is gone but the buyer did not bother to take the augers or even the fittings on the bottom of the tank. I waited a year and one half for the buyer to come back for the rest of what he paid for but it never happened. I guess he figured he got a good enough deal on the tanks and he didn&#8217;t need the other old junk.<br />
At that point I advertised the augers and motors on Craigs List. A couple of young fellows from up north responded. We laughed  and talked and dealt.  They left with all the remaining equipment.<br />
The next big problem was the many yards of cement walls that divided the hog pens. They were 42 inches high and poured in place with steel reinforcing. I tried to remove them by hand but they were built well. After several hours of work with little progress I gave up. I didn&#8217;t know what to do next.<br />
The next spring The Wife and I decided to have our driveway paved to keep mud and dirt out of the house. The contractor was a local fellow, knowledgeable and friendly. In the course of visiting with the fellow, the Hog Barn came up. I showed him the project, and explained my inability to remove the cement partitions. He smiled and said, &#8221; make a way for me to get my skid loader in and I will have them out in a couple of hours&#8221;. With a little help I cut a hole in the wall where a garage door would someday be and we were on our way.<br />
I wish I had taken pictures of the process. The jack hammer mounted to the front of the skid loader cut the cement like butter, it was amazing. Then the pieces were stacked outside in a big pile. Two days later they were hauled away for recycling. What I had considered the most difficult job turned into the easiest.<br />
I swept and cleaned some, but other projects took president. This spring I became determined to complete this project. I pulled my old pressure washer out of the back of my shop where it had been sitting for a few years. Cleaned it up and checked it over and it worked fine. I even found the strong detergent that I have had tucked away for 15 years. First I shut the electric power off to the building and then began washing. Wash it, let it soak, hit it again, let it soak again, than rinse it. I worked on this several different days, because I every time I would came back I would see spots I had missed.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-hog-barn-starting-doors-A.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1018" title="E hog barn starting doors A" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/E-hog-barn-starting-doors-A-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />

On your right you can see the rough cement where  we cut through the wall. I learned to use a masonry cut off blade in my skill saw and a masonry grinding wheel in my hand grinder. You can see in the left picture that they do a nice job. The dust from these tools is hard to tolerate. The hot weather made my dust mask uncomfortable but the head ache and cough that came if I didn&#8217;t wear it was much worse.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/G-hog-barn-starting-doors-4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1028" title="G hog barn starting doors 4" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/G-hog-barn-starting-doors-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> Slowly the project moved on. There were many little things to fix, as time and moisture had taken its toll. The sloping floor where the garage door opening had been cut was a problem. Also the structure of the building limited the space available for a garage door. Plans had to change as I went along.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/I-hog-barn-wall-damage-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1031" title="I hog barn wall damage 1" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/I-hog-barn-wall-damage-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/I-hog-barn-wall-damage-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1032" title="I hog barn wall damage 2" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/I-hog-barn-wall-damage-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
The picture below and on left shows where the particle board in the wall under the plastic wall covering had rotted away. What I found surprising was the condition of the insulation. The walls had been filled with six inch bats of fibreglass. Where ever I opened the walls, the insulation was like this. This makes me wonder about insulation in my house walls. Most repairs were fairly simple, they  just took a lot of time. I used up much lumber that I had tucked away.<br />
The walk in door and frame on this end needed to be replaced. I had an old door I had salvaged but there was no Knob or latch for it and its frame was damaged. I lucked out, Habitat for Humanity&#8217;s thrift store had a complete door set up for a bit less than 30 dollars. That was cheaper than the cost of a new knob set. The picture on the left and below is the door installed, not bad for a barn.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/J-walk-in-door-in-place.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1039" title="J walk in door in place" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/J-walk-in-door-in-place-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/K-laying-floor.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1041" title="K laying floor" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/K-laying-floor-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> On the right is a picture of laying of the floor. The Barn had a cement slatted floor with a pit for manure under it. Exhaust fans pulled fresh air through the slats and blew the smelly air outside. I had cleaned the pit, but the old smell was still there. I didn&#8217;t want to run fans all the time so I did the following. I used roofing sealer and tar paper, then covered the slats with particle board. I used two layers with overlapping joints and screwed them together. it is an air tight floor.<br />
notice the walls are rusty red from the cooling sprinklers that were run on hot summer days. compare that to next pictures of the finished inside. My wife removed them all with toilet bowl cleaner, A big improvement.<br />
<a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/l-fininished-inside.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1045" title="l fininished inside" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/l-fininished-inside-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/L-Hog-Barn-finished-inside-east-.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1046" title="L Hog Barn finished inside east" src="http://www.lightningrodlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/L-Hog-Barn-finished-inside-east--300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
These two pictures show the project which is pretty much finished. It makes a good storage building. clean and nice inside. At 26 by 56 feet it is a lot of space. I plan to add some more shelving for small stuff. Many things can be hung on the wall like the old hubcaps.<br />
Below is the finished outside<br />
