				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have the trucks pictured below. They are all <strong>1/64 scale</strong> made by the <strong>Ertl Co</strong>. and are still in their original packaging. They are all die cast metal with rubber tires on them.<br />
First is the limited edition Land-O-Lakes produced for and sold only by the Toy Farmer magazine in 1995. I think it sold originality for $29.00. As you can see in the picture, it has a beautiful picture on the side of the trailer. The truck in the picture is of the one I have on display, The one I am selling is still in its original box.<br />
Second is the Blue and White Coke Freight-Liner made by Ertl in 1998<br />
Third is the Yellow Coke Peterbuilt made by Ertl in 1997</p>

I will sell them for <strong>$20.00 each</strong>, plus postage. I do take PayPal. I can be reached at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net</strong></p>
